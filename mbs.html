    <p> The purpose of this work is to give the viewer an inside look into the artist's mind, body, and soul. Using
        images the audience is free to interpret the symbolism of the images as it relates to the artist.
        This triptych is separated into three collages, Mind, Body, and Spirit. The vision for the mind collage is
        to depict how my mind works and feels at times. I'm an overthinker so I found the image of â€œthe Thinker" to
        be fitting. There is a lot of other symbolism that lies within the collage, such as the night sky and the
        sponge. The sky representing my calm thinking space, and the sponge symbolic of my eagerness to learn
        and explore. The bridge between the spirit and mind is the body. The body collage is symbolic of my
        physical apperance as well as my heritage. The purple flower represents my hair, the mushroom my height,
        the flag my heritage, and the person is symbolic of how I feel most of the time. The last collage is the spirit
        collage. This collage represents who I am creatively and internally. These collages work together because
        although they are drastically different, the body collage helps to bridge the composition together and well
        as symbolically.
        The purpose of this work is exhibited when viewed left to right. Although the three are different they
        are bridged together by the body collage. Although each piece has its differences there are many
        similarities across the three that depict symbolic references to the artist.
