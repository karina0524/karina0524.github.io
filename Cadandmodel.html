<h1> CAD MODEL & 3D PRINT</h1>
<p> This assighment consisted of designing a model for 3d printing. This was done in 
    TinkerCad. The jet is based off the F1 Raptor Jet. I created the jet by breaking
it down to the simplest of shapes. The following images display the model in 3D as well as it
it's design and model.  </p>
