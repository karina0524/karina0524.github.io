        <h1> Net Art:Launch</h1>
        <p>  This is a net art created using html. The web pages are based on the sentence “Ethereal Like the Small creative century” This sentence was created using a randomizing method sourcing words from articles and a generator to determine the words and in what order they would read. Once the sentence topic was developed I created a page for every word. I linked all pages using the words in the sentence as they appear in the page. All pages have a common theme of what I view as ethereal such as the moon.
