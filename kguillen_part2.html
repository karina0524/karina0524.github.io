        <h1>What I did last Wednesday Part 2 Alfonso pov.</h1>
        <p style= "font-family:fantasy;color: darkolivegreen">I woke up in the middle of the night because I felt cold. I did not know why I felt cold if Im covered in fur. As I opened my eyes I realized I was no longer covered in fur. All I saw was skin. I felt utterly naked and disgusted. I thought I was having an outter body experience because I saw myself at the foot of the bed. That when it hit met, great I had switched places with my food server.I did not feel like getting up becuase I couldn't live with myself if I walked on two legs vs the four I had, it just isn't practical. I just layed myself back down contemplating what I had done to deserve this. I mean don't get me wrong It must be nice having thumbs, and opening door knobs and wet food. But if you ask me nothing beats sunbathing, oh how I miss the sun. I don't wanna get up and risk falling. Then i'll just look dumb. Especially when I had a reputation of landing on all fours.I was doing just fine laying down when I heard a loud thump. That's when I positioned myself upwards and saw my cat body spazzed out on the ground. I asssumed it must have been the human, but why must she embarrass me. So humiliating. As we starred at each other I smelt something awful. I kept sniffing trying to investigate but my nose wasn't picking up scents as best as it used to. Then I heard the most unpleasant sound come out of my cat body. </p>
