<h1> Solder Project</h1>
<p> For this workshop I learned how to sssemble and solder an
    electronics kit. I was introduced to a variety of tools and a 
    printed circuit Board. With the tools and board we were given, our final product would be 
    functioning LED's that lit up due to its sensor. The video below displays the LED's in action.
