        <h1> What I did last Wenesday Part 3 Manchitas pov</h1>
        <p style="font-family:Verdana;color:crimson">So I was just minding my buisness jumping on counters and being in places I know i'm not suppose to, when suddenly I heard my older brother fall from the bed of our food server.I was very confused because he's not like that. I wanted to check it out but I really had to pee. Luckily our poop box was down the hall from the food server's room. So I decided to go investigate. I arrived at the door and went unoticed at first. I saw Alfonso struggle as if he had never walked on his paws before. That's when the food server awoke and sat up.Then she and Alfonso starred at each other. It was really strange. But then the funniest thinig happend, Alfonso let out the most hilarious meow I had ever heard. Usually we meow when we want something and the food server listens. This time I had no idea what Alfosnos wanted. I just knew it was the funniest thing. Then the food server began sniffing, as if she had caught wind of something foul. That when I realized I had peed due to Alfonso's meow. That when I kenw it was time to run.</p>
