    <h1>What I did last Wednesday</h1> 
    <p style="font-family:times;color:white" >As I went to wipe the eye crust from my eyes I felt something soft touch my my eyes.I assumed it was my cat so I opened them and say a paw. However it wasn't my cat's paw but my own, I had woken up as Alfonso.As I woke up I noticed that I was on my bed but not in the place I normally awake, I was at the foot of my bed. Meanwhile my human body was still asleep. I wondered since I had switched places with my cat, had my cat woken up as myself? As I got up it was very difficult learning to walk on all fours.I fell off the bed, quite dramatically. Turns out cats don't always fall straight on all fours. After my fall I notied that my human self had woken up. We both just stared at each other, that much didn't change. As I continued staring my human self had begun sniffing everything. I assumed my human self had realized that they were now a cat. I attemted to speak but the strangest noise came out. Not at all a meow but more like a screeching yelp that came out like a party horn. At that point my cat self and my human self mad eye contact again.</p>
